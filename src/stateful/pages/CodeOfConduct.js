            <h1> Lanka Data Foundation (LDF) Code of Conduct </h1>

            <p> The Lanka Data Foundation (LDF) Code of Conduct (“The Code”) recognizes that a core objective of LDF is
                to make public data more freely accessible and process-able for the general public and foster a culture
                where Sri Lankans use data in all aspects of their lives. </p>

            <p> The Code is a publicly available document that may be accessed through the website <a
                href="https://datafoundation.lk/"> https://datafoundation.lk/ </a>. It is intended to protect users as
                well as the LDF organization and brand. It is for use:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> By our partners and clients.</li>
                <li> By our leadership and management teams, help them ensure that the decisions they make, the role
                    models they are and the expectations they have of their colleagues take into account their
                    responsibilities.
                </li>
                <li> By new and prospective employees and volunteers</li>
                <li> By the general public.</li>
            </ul>


            <p> The Code will be reviewed from time to time and will incorporate comments and suggestions from
                employees, volunteers, partners and the public in efforts to maintain it and keep it up to date. </p>

            <p> This Code does not purport to replace legal advice or provide legal guidance. Partners should inform
                themselves about relevant laws that may be applicable to the industry or scope of work they are engaging
                in. </p>

                </li>
                <li> where using our data feeds, please if possible cache the data over a short period of time to reduce

                <li> where you cannot use our live sources as the primary data source, please still use the keys
                    contained within the data as the primary or foreign keys within your application, as this will
                    enable you to migrate as simply as possible to up-to-date data and
